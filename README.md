This project performs emotion classification on text comments using a fine-tuned BERT model. It includes all steps from data preprocessing, tokenization, and training, to evaluation and sample predictions. The model is built using the Hugging Face transformers library and PyTorch, and supports multi-class classification for emotions like joy, anger, and fear. The code is organized in a single Jupyter notebook (Code_RM_A2.ipynb) and works with a labeled dataset (Emotion_classify_Data.csv). To run the notebook, required libraries include transformers, torch, nltk, and wordcloud.
